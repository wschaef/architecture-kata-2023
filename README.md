## Context

This repository contains the results produced by the Team "Magenta Force" during the 
[Architectural Kata @ O’Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/architectural-katas/0636920097101/0636920097100/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=platform+b2b&utm_campaign=superstream&utm_content=20230910+reminder2+lot)

An "architectural kata" is a concept borrowed from martial arts and adapted for use in the field of software architecture and design. It refers to a structured and purposeful exercise or practice session where software architects, developers, or teams work on solving a specific architectural problem or challenge.

The term "kata" comes from martial arts, where it represents a choreographed sequence of movements or techniques designed to develop and refine specific skills. In the context of software architecture, an architectural kata is a way to improve architectural skills and promote best practices through deliberate practice.

## Initial Event of the Architectural Kata 

As participants, we took part at the initial Architectural Kata event:

1. **Introduction**: The O'Reilly team provided a comprehensive introduction to Architectural Kata, a unique learning approach in software architecture.

2. **Guiding the Process**: Throughout the event, we followed a systematic process for solving complex architectural challenges.

3. **Key Concepts**: We embraced some architectural concepts shared by the hosts, forming the foundation for our solutions.

4. **Learning from Examples**: Past Architectural Katas were shared as real-world examples, providing valuable insights and inspiration.

5. **Distinguished Judges**: We met experienced judges who offered valuable feedback and insights, enhancing our understanding and skills.

6. **Transparent Criteria**: The hosts explained the judging criteria clearly, helping us tailor our solutions to meet the event's objectives.

7. **The Challenge**: Finally O'Reilly team provided the [Problem Description](input.md)

## Results

We had about 5 days time to design an architecture for the given [Problem Description](input.md).
The starting point is the [architecture.md](architecture.md). Have fun with it and feel free to comment.

We also happy to share [lessons learned](lessons-learned.md) from some of our team members.
