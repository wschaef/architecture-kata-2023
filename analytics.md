# My thoughts about the analytical space
- partner agencies would like to have an aggregated view about all available travel data of their customers
- social media integration [FR7]: Users should also be able to share their trip information by interfacing with standard social media sites or allowing targeted people to view your trip.
- [FR6] - Items in the dashboard should be able to be grouped by trip, and once the trip is complete, the items should automatically be removed
- [FR3] - Filter and whitelist certain emails

- travel specifi combination of hotel, traffic medium (flight, train, Taxi what ever is available ), durations, destinations

## sperate anylyitical stack vs enrichment:


Coming from a start-up situation and a MVP process with quick time2market we have to assume application-driven analytics. There are now data platforms that bring together operational and analytical workloads into one (avoid data duplication, lot's of integration works, flexibility to adopt).
